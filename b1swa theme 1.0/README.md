**b1swa** is not just a browser extension; it's a high-performance **Integrated Security Hub**. It transforms your standard "New Tab" into a real-time cybersecurity command center, blending elite aesthetics with powerful protection tools.

## 🛡️ The Main Function: Integrated Security Command Center

The core of **b1swa** is the **Integrated Security Hub**. Unlike standard security extensions that hide in the background, **b1swa** puts your digital safety front and center.

### 📜 Unified Security Hub
We've integrated your entire security posture into a single, high-tech panel:
- **Live Security Logs:** Real-time feed of blocked threats, upgrades, and system events.
- **Global Protection Metrics:** Instant visibility into Ads, Trackers, and Threats blocked across all your browsing.
- **Persistent Intelligence:** Your security history is saved locally, providing long-term insights into your protection status.

## 🚀 Why b1swa is Different

Most browser extensions are tools; **b1swa** is an experience.

### 1. Elite Cyberpunk Identity
Built for those who live in the terminal. Featuring a **dynamic Matrix-style binary rain** background and a **blinking terminal-style brand prompt (`>_ b1swa`)**, it provides the most immersive "hacker" aesthetic available.

### 2. Interactive "htop" System Monitor
Visualize your browser's pulse with an interactive, terminal-style resource monitor. Track your **real-time CPU, Memory, and Network usage** in a layout that feels like a mission control center.

### 3. Proactive Homoglyph Detection
We don't just block known bad sites; we protect you from **Homoglyph (look-alike URL) attacks**. Our advanced background engine scans for subtle character replacements (e.g., `gооgle.com` vs `google.com`) and stops phishing in its tracks.
